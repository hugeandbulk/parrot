**concept:**

Parrots:— talk, screech, gurgle, trill, whistle, and squawk.

"The Parrot name made sense, when it's just up to 1000 character messages going back and forth – like Parrot gurgle – but you can post almost anything, including messages, links, photographs etc."

The user of parrot can send `mails` to the another user or recipient.
