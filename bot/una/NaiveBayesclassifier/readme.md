## Naive Bayes classifier

What is a Naive Bayes classifier?

Naïve Bayes classifiers. The Naïve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification. It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category.

What is Naive Bayes classifier best for?

multi-class prediction problems

Naive Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class prediction problems. If its assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform better than other models and requires much less training data. Naive Bayes is better suited for categorical input variables than numerical variables.

Why is it called Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.

What are the parameters of Naive Bayes?

The parameters that are learned in Naive Bayes are the prior probabilities of different classes, as well as the likelihood of different features for each class. In the test phase, these learned parameters are used to estimate the probability of each class for the given sample.

What are the applications of naive Bayes?

Applications of Naïve Bayes Classifier:

It is used in medical data classification. It can be used in real-time predictions because Naïve Bayes Classifier is an eager learner. It is used in Text classification such as Spam filtering and Sentiment analysis.

Is naive Bayes a clustering algorithm?

Naive Bayes inference is a very common technique for performing data classification, but it's not generally known that Naive Bayes can also be used for data clustering.

Which algorithm is better than naive Bayes?

In the former case, Naive Bayes is probably the better choice, while Decision Trees will most likely outperform it in the latter. Are we trying to predict a class that appears very rarely in a data set? If that's the case, it will likely be pruned out using the decision tree, and we won't get the desirable results.

What is a real life example of naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is mostly used in real-world applications like sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems, etc. They are extremely fast and easy to implement as compared to other machine learning models.

What is the formula for Bayes classifier?

The simple form of the calculation for Bayes Theorem is as follows: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Is naive Bayes a linear classifier?

Naive Bayes is a linear classifier

The boundary of the ellipsoids indicate regions of equal probabilities P(x|y). The red decision line indicates the decision boundary where P(y=1|x)=P(y=2|x).

Is Naive Bayes supervised or unsupervised Why?

Naive Bayes is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Hence, it is also called Naive Bayes Classifier. As other supervised learning algorithms, naive bayes uses features to make a prediction on a target variable.

What is the zero probability problem in Naive Bayes?

The zero-frequency problem

One of the disadvantages of Naïve-Bayes is that if you have no occurrences of a class label and a certain attribute value together then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero. And this will get a zero when all the probabilities are multiplied.

What are the other names for naive Bayes?

In the statistics literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.

Is Naive Bayes only for binary classification?

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multi-class classification problems. The technique is easiest to understand when described using binary or categorical input values.
