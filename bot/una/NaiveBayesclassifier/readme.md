## Naive Bayes classifier

What is a Naive Bayes classifier?

Na誰ve Bayes classifiers. The Na誰ve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification. It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category.

What is Naive Bayes classifier best for?

multi-class prediction problems

Naive Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class prediction problems. If its assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform better than other models and requires much less training data. Naive Bayes is better suited for categorical input variables than numerical variables.

Why is it called Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.

What are the parameters of Naive Bayes?

The parameters that are learned in Naive Bayes are the prior probabilities of different classes, as well as the likelihood of different features for each class. In the test phase, these learned parameters are used to estimate the probability of each class for the given sample.

What are the applications of naive Bayes?

Applications of Na誰ve Bayes Classifier:

It is used in medical data classification. It can be used in real-time predictions because Na誰ve Bayes Classifier is an eager learner. It is used in Text classification such as Spam filtering and Sentiment analysis.

Is naive Bayes a clustering algorithm?

Naive Bayes inference is a very common technique for performing data classification, but it's not generally known that Naive Bayes can also be used for data clustering.
