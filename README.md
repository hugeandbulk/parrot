Parrot â€” gurgle

_Parrots sing when they are happy, just like a human in the shower. The song is an ever-changing mixture of the bird's favourite sounds, from gurgles and trills to whistles and squawks._

`Common binary number lengths`

`Each 1 or 0 in a binary number is called a bit. From there, a group of 4 bits is called a nibble, and 8-bits makes a byte.`
