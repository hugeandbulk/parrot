How does the parrot make sound?

The vocal organ that enables a parrot to make sounds is called the syrinx which is located within the bird's breast. This vocal organ is a muscular, wishbone structure located at the base of the trachea adjacent to two bronchi (sort of like an upside down Y) where the trachea meets the lungs.

What do parrots say when they talk?

The “talking” we hear from parrots is mimicry of all sorts of sounds. They imitate many things, from spoken words to creaking doors to barking dogs. Most parrots are simply mimicking their owners. They don't really know what they're saying.
